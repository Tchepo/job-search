> We want team members who are passionate about our mission. If you’re excited about helping people live healthier and longer lives, tell us about a moment or experience that sparked your interest in healthcare.

During my time in Colombia, I had multiple opportunities to observe the private healthcare sector closely.
I was struck by the remarkable efficiency of the system—patients were triaged, diagnosed, and treated with impressive speed and coordination in the emergency department of local clinics.
The staff operated like a well-oiled machine, and the technology supporting their workflows was clearly optimized for rapid decision-making.

> Engineering experience

> Describe a specific project that you’re proud of where you had an impact across the stack. What made this project particularly meaningful or challenging for you as a full-stack developer?

The most meaningful and challenging projects I've worked on was co-founding Geophysics Anywhere.
The startup focused on seismic data processing.
As a full-stack developer, I led the design and development of a SaaS platform that enabled intuitive seismic data analysis for geophysicists, combining backend data processing with a user-friendly frontend interface.
