€70,000 - €90,000

  

I'm currently supporting an innovative Paris-based startup on a mission to transform medical technology and improve lives. Their breakthrough robotic platform is pioneering automated, high-resolution full-body imaging, bringing cutting-edge advances in computer vision, graphics, and robotics to healthcare. With their launch on the horizon, they are growing quickly and looking for passionate engineers who are excited to tackle technical challenges with real-world impact.

  

As a Senior HPC Software Engineer, you’ll play a central role in developing and optimizing core modules of their robotic acquisition and imaging system. Working closely with an expert team in computer vision, computer graphics, and robotics, you will:

*   Design, develop, and maintain the architecture powering their platform.
*   Build high-performance GPU algorithms for image reconstruction pipelines.
*   Strengthen system reliability and robustness to reach medical-grade standards.
*   Industrialise and optimise calibration systems and hardware drivers.
*   Collaborate with machine learning and software engineers to ensure system safety, accuracy, and performance.

  

**What I'm looking for**

You’re an engineer with strong problem-solving ability, a passion for technical excellence, and experience in building high-performance systems. More concretely, you bring:

*   Solid expertise in **C++17/20** development.
*   Proficiency in **GPU programming** and parallel computing (CUDA, CuBLAS, CuSPARSE, CuTLaSS).
*   Hands-on experience with **multi-threaded programming, compilers, optimisation, and design patterns**.
*   Knowledge of **computer vision, graphics, or robotic control algorithms**.
*   Familiarity with scripting (e.g., Python) and collaborative development (Git, best practices).
*   A curious, entrepreneurial mindset and the ability to thrive in a fast-paced environment.

  

**Bonus points if you have**

*   Experience with libraries like Boost, Eigen, OpenGL, Protobuf, Qt.
*   Low-level driver development (sensors, cameras) or networking protocols.
*   Real-time Linux kernel knowledge.
*   Optical physics or industrial imaging background.
*   Experience with unit testing, benchmarking, profiling, and debugging tools (GTest, Valgrind, NSight, GDB).

  

**What they can offer**

*   Competitive salary package
*   A modern, central Paris office
*   A warm, collaborative culture with real growth opportunities
*   The chance to directly impact healthcare and improve lives
