## About the job

**C++ Software Engineer**

  

This position would be working as a Software Engineer for an interesting deep-tech start-up who are working in the CV/ML and Medical sector, assembling a world-class team of scientists and engineers to build breakthrough products for a positive purpose. This company are using image processing & computer vision techniques to detect very early signs of skin cancer, far quicker than current practices. They have created their own autonomous robot which scans the human body to more efficiently detect cancers saving time for the medical profession.

  

You will work closely with the team on the computer vision, computer graphics and robotic control modules including:

*   Developing and maintaining the architecture and modules (research, production) of their robotic acquisition system.
*   Designing and developing the image reconstruction pipeline algorithms on the GPU to achieve outstanding throughput performances.
*   You would also develop and optimize the system’s core modules to bring them to medical-grade reliability and robustness.
*   Optimize and industrialize several calibration modules and low-level hardware drivers.
*   Partner with machine learning & software engineers to find new solutions, and ensure overall system’s safety and accuracy.

  

Requirements:

*   Strong problem solving and mathematical skills.
*   Excellent command of C++ software development (C++17/20).
*   GPU programming and parallel computing (CUDA11, CuBlas, CuSparse, CuTLASS).
*   Strong experience with design patterns, multi-threaded programs, modern compilers, code optimization.
*   Good knowledge of computer vision, computer graphics and/or robotic control algorithms.

  

A strong plus would be to have experience with:

*   libraries such as Boost, Eigen, OpenGL, Protobuf, Qt.
*   Manipulating hardware and developing low level drivers (sensors, cameras).
*   Network based communication protocols.
*   Real-time Linux kernels.
*   Optical physics and industrial imaging systems.
*   Writing unit tests with Google test suite & Benchmark.
*   Low-level debugging & profiling using Valgrind, Gdb, NSight Systems & Compute.
